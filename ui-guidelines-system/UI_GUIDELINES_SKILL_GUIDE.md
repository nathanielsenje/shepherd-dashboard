# UI Guidelines System Skill - Getting Started Guide

Welcome! This skill helps you establish and maintain a consistent design system by extracting design guidelines from sample UI images and applying them across all your components.

## What This Skill Does

The **UI Guidelines System** skill provides three primary workflows:

### 1. üìä **Extract Guidelines from UI Images**
Analyze a UI sample (like the Sence Point template you provided) to automatically derive:
- Complete color palette with semantic meanings
- Typography system (font families, scales, weights)
- Spacing and sizing scales
- Shadow and elevation system
- Border radius patterns
- Component specifications for all UI elements

**Output:** A comprehensive markdown file with design tokens and component documentation.

### 2. üîç **Review Components for Compliance**
Take existing React/Vue/HTML components and:
- Check them against your extracted guidelines
- Identify deviations and inconsistencies
- Generate compliance reports
- Suggest specific corrections

**Output:** Detailed compliance report with recommendations.

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Generate or Recreate Components**
Build new components or recreate existing ones that:
- Follow your extracted design guidelines exactly
- Use design tokens consistently
- Include all component variants and states
- Provide production-ready code

**Output:** Ready-to-use component code in React/Vue/HTML.

## Quick Start: How to Use This Skill

### Scenario 1: Extract Guidelines from Your UI Image

You have the Sence Point template image and want comprehensive design guidelines.

**What to do:**
```
"Please extract UI guidelines from my design template image. 
I need a comprehensive markdown document covering:
- Colors (primary, semantic, neutral, gradients)
- Typography (fonts, scales, weights)
- Spacing scale
- Shadows and elevation
- Border radius
- All 13 component types: buttons, cards, badges, modals, 
  sidebar navigation, tags, forms, text styles, images, 
  tooltips, tables, counters, and charts.

Output as a single markdown file."
```

**The skill will:**
1. Analyze your template image visually
2. Extract all design characteristics
3. Generate a markdown guideline document following the template structure
4. Provide design tokens for each category
5. Document each component with specifications and code examples

**You'll receive:**
- A `.md` file with complete design system documentation
- Ready-to-reference design tokens
- Component specifications for all 13 types

---

### Scenario 2: Review Your Existing Components

You have React components built and want to ensure they follow guidelines.

**What to do:**
```
"I have extracted design guidelines saved in this file [paste guidelines]. 
Please review my React Button component [paste code] for compliance.
Check against the guidelines for:
- Color tokens usage
- Spacing/padding consistency
- Typography
- State handling (hover, active, disabled, focus)
- Shadow elevation usage"
```

**The skill will:**
1. Load your extracted guidelines
2. Analyze your component code
3. Compare against each design token
4. Identify all deviations
5. Generate a detailed compliance report with specific fixes

**You'll receive:**
- Compliance analysis
- List of deviations with line numbers
- Suggested corrections
- Patterns to apply across other components

---

### Scenario 3: Recreate Components Using Guidelines

You want your existing components rebuilt to strictly follow guidelines.

**What to do:**
```
"Using these extracted guidelines [paste guidelines], 
please recreate my Button components in React/Tailwind.
Build all variants:
- Sizes: sm, md, lg
- Variants: primary, secondary, tertiary, ghost
- States: default, hover, active, disabled, focus, loading

Output production-ready code with:
- All design tokens applied
- Full state handling
- Component props documented
- Usage examples"
```

**The skill will:**
1. Parse your guidelines for token values
2. Generate components with token applications
3. Include all specified variants and states
4. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
5. Provide ready-to-copy code

**You'll receive:**
- Production-ready component files
- All variants implemented
- Clear prop documentation
- Copy-paste ready code

1. **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, tertiary, ghost; multiple sizes
2. **Cards** - Container layouts, shadows, hover effects
3. **Badges** - Inline labels, color variants
4. **Modals** - Dialog boxes with overlay
5. **Sidebar Navigation** - Menu items, active states, collapsible sections
6. **Tags & Status Tags** - Semantic color badges
7. **Forms** - Inputs, labels, validation states
8. **Text Styles** - Typography hierarchy (h1-h6, body, captions)
9. **Images** - Aspect ratios, borders, containers
10. **Tooltips** - Hover information with positioning
11. **Tables** - Headers, rows, pagination, sorting
12. **Counters** - Badge-style count indicators
13. **Charts** - Data visualization components

```

### Component Code Formats

The skill can generate components in:
- **React/JSX** with Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- **Vue/SFC** with scoped styles
- **HTML/CSS** vanilla implementation
- **Web Components** custom elements

---

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Fresh Start (Image ‚Üí Guidelines ‚Üí Components)

```
Step 1: "Extract complete design guidelines from this UI template"
        ‚Üí You get: design-system.md with all tokens and specs

Step 2: "Generate all Button component variants following these guidelines"
        ‚Üí You get: Button.jsx with all variants ready

Step 3: "Generate Card component with all documented variations"
        ‚Üí You get: Card.jsx production-ready code

Step 4: "Generate Form components (Input, Label, HelperText)"
        ‚Üí You get: Form components collection
```

### Example 2: Review & Update (Existing Components ‚Üí Compliance ‚Üí Fixed Code)

```
Step 1: "Review my existing Button component against the guidelines"
        ‚Üí You get: Compliance report with issues

Step 2: "Here are the issues found. Recreate the Button fixing these."
        ‚Üí You get: Updated Button.jsx

Step 3: "Apply the same fixes to my Card and Form components"
        ‚Üí You get: Updated components
```

### Example 3: Guideline-First Development (Guidelines ‚Üí New Components)

```
Step 1: Have extracted guidelines in your reference
Step 2: For each new component: "Build [component] following guidelines"
Step 3: Component is created with 100% token compliance
