- Typography system (fonts, scales, weights, line heights)
- Spacing scale
- Shadows and elevation
- Border radius patterns
- All 13 component types

**Output:** Markdown file with design tokens and component specs

### 2. Review Components for Compliance 🔍
Check existing components against guidelines

**Analyzes:**
- Design token usage
- Spacing consistency
- Typography compliance
- State handling
- Shadow elevation
- Border radius adherence

**Output:** Detailed compliance report with recommendations
